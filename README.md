## DISCLAIMER:

This project is for personal self-learning and experimentation with Python and encryption techniques. While it includes basic encryption and secure password storage methods, it is not intended for real-world or commercial use, as it may lack the advanced security features required for robust protection. Users are advised to handle sensitive information with caution and to rely on professionally-developed password management tools with advanced security practices for storing real-world data.
